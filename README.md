Title: Python code for converting an image to equirectangular format

Description: This Python code demonstrates how to convert a normal image to equirectangular format using the Pillow library. The code takes an image file path, desired width and height of the equirectangular image as input, and generates an equirectangular image with the same dimensions as output. The equirectangular image is created by mapping the pixels of the original image onto a 2D representation of a sphere. The code handles the resizing, mapping and saving of the equirectangular image.
